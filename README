Our Program will allow the user to input how many courses they are taking and how much credit each course is worth. 
The user input will then be calculated to determine if the user will qualify for a certain scholarship program within the system. 
Then the cumulative GPA will be calculated to see if they still have the scholarship for the following semesters. 
At the end of your college semester, it will then tell you how much money you owe the university after scholarships.
